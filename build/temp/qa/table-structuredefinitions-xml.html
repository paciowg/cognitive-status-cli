 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-pacio-cognition-qr.xml.html">PACIO Cognition Questionnaire Response</a> </td><td><p>A completed, or sections of a completed, CMS PAC assessment.</p>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-pacio-cs.xml.html">PACIO Cognitive Status</a> </td><td><p>An exchange of cognitive status observation for a patient. This profile is used for exchanging a single observation data generally included in a set of observation data collected through the use of a structured resource (e.g. assessment tool, instrument, or screen).</p>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-pacio-csc.xml.html">PACIO Cognitive Status Collection</a> </td><td><p>A point in time collection of cognitive status observations for a patient. This profile is used for exchanging a set of observation data collected through the use of a structured resource (e.g. assessment tool, instrument, or screen).</p>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-pacio-plcf.xml.html">PACIO Prior Level of Cognitive Function</a> </td><td><p>An exchange of summary observation regarding the most recent prior level of cognitive function immediately preceding the current admission, illness, or exacerbation for a patient. The use of this profile is encouraged in the absence of formal prior level of cognitive assessments. For formal assessments conducted with for example, an assessment instructment, use the Cognitive Status Collecction and Cognitive Status profiles to capture assessment data.</p>

 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-pacio-cs-dev.xml.html">Use of Device</a> </td><td><p>A record of an assistive device--e.g. eyeglasses or hearing aid, being used by a patient during a cognitive status assessment. This profile based on the DeviceUseStatement resource provides a way to include information about device usage during an assessment.</p>

 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-assistance-required.xml.html">AssistanceRequired</a> </td><td><p>Associated with prior level of cognitive function to provide a high-level indication of assistance required for the person’s baseline ability (cognitive function immediately preceding the current admission, illness, or exacerbation for a patient) to answer cognitive related clinical questions. The CMS Assessment answer list LL4309-2 provides possible values for this extension.</p>
</td></tr>
 <tr><td><a href="StructureDefinition-device-patient-used.xml.html">DevicePatientUsed</a> </td><td><p>A record indicating what healthcare-related assistive device was used by a patient during a cognitive status assessment. This extension leverages the DeviceUseStatement resource instead of Device resource so as to indicate appropriately a record of assistive device usage by a patient.</p>
